When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    with remote repo u can work on your project from different computer or gain
    access to diferent people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    because when pulling chages manually you can specify what branch you want 
    to pull, while automaticly git will pull all accessible branches.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    forks are used when u need to copy someone repo to add your versions
    clones are used when you need to copy repo to your local repo.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    you can return to that state anytime and resolve any merging conflicts.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    I guess we would send our code manualy (thru emails or other tools), and it would be harder 
    to review code and give feedback on it.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    whenever you need to add new feature and test it, it will be more effective
    to create separete brench test it first and then merge this branch into master.
